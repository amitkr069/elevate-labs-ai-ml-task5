Preprocessing - checked for null values(not found). Dropped the unnecessary features.

Trained the Decision Tree Classifier and visualized the tree.
Analyzed overfitting in the model and controled the tree depth with max depth of 8.
Found the optimal depth by cross validation.
Train a Random Forest and compared the accuracy with the decision tree.
Interpreted feature importances and plotted its graph.
Evaluated both the models using cross-validation, by getting its mean and standard deviation.
